# Storage and indexes

## Bulk store IO backends

**Bulk batch** uses a **single** switch: `RBITCOIN_IO=uring|pool|iocp|pread` (default uring
when available). Table transport is always **fd pread/pwrite**. Compact Class C
is L2 write-behind; see [`docs/io-modality.md`](../io-modality.md). Per-path
env overrides are **removed**. If `uring` is selected but setup fails, demote to
**pread** / **pwrite**. If a live ring stops completing (`drain slow`, then abort),
restart with **`RBITCOIN_IO=pread`** — the process does not switch backends itself.

| Env | Values | Note |
|-----|--------|------|
| **`RBITCOIN_IO`** | `uring` \| `pool` \| `iocp` \| `pread` | Only bulk switch |

Inventory / survivors: [`docs/env-knobs.md`](../env-knobs.md).
Token meanings and ring depth: [`docs/io-modality.md`](../io-modality.md).
`RWF_DONTCACHE` is not used ([`SCHEMA.md`](../../SCHEMA.md) Schema 17 freeze).

## Defaults and memory budgets

| Knob | Default | Override |
|------|---------|----------|
| IBD concurrent getdata | **1024** | code `IbdConfig::window` |
| Blocks in transit / peer | **64** | `IbdConfig::per_peer` (16 MiB payload cap per peer) |
| Live IBD peers | **16** | `--max-outbound` |
| Inbound P2P sessions | **125** | `--max-inbound`. At capacity, unprotected inbounds are evicted. Incomplete VERSION/VERACK is dropped after **60 s** (releases the slot). |
| Milestone (script skip) | mainnet anchor **840000**, testnet3 anchor **2500000**, signet **0**, regtest 0 | `--milestone` (`0` = full scripts; explicit height is height-only) |
| ConfirmParentCache header plans | always on | Tip-ahead header + tx_fks for multi-block MTP (no create pin FIFO) |
| Bulk store IO | **uring** (Linux) when available | `RBITCOIN_IO` only. Matrix: [`docs/io-modality.md`](../io-modality.md) |
| Archive Class A append | **pwrite** (always) | `txout` / `seqsigwit` / `spent` plus `create.loc` / `seqsigwit.loc` |
| `tx.head` (segmented) | fixed geometry | Default **25-bit**. Rebuild env: [`docs/env-knobs.md`](../env-knobs.md). Bytes: [`SCHEMA.md`](../../SCHEMA.md) / [`docs/heads.md`](../heads.md). Legacy mono-head datadirs require reindex |
| Confirm stages | **lookup · load · scripts · write** | Queues and pack/wave: [`docs/concurrency.md`](../concurrency.md). RAM: [`docs/ibd-memory.md`](../ibd-memory.md) |
| Confirm batch inputs | **8000** soft | Hardcoded. Live line: `h= n= in=` (**n** = blocks in pack, **in** = Σ inputs) |
| Mempool weight budget | **~300e6 WU** | `--mempool-size-mb N` (maps N×1e6 WU) |
| Inhibit auto-suspend | **off** | `--inhibit-suspend` (uses `systemd-inhibit` if available) |

### Suspend inhibit

Long IBD runs can be interrupted if the host auto-suspends. Pass
`--inhibit-suspend` to request a systemd **block** inhibit for `sleep` and
`idle` while the process runs (via `systemd-inhibit`). Default is off. If
`systemd-inhibit` is missing or logind rejects the request, the node logs a
warning and continues without inhibit.

**Peers file:** `{datadir}/peers` stores discovered addresses and **PeerFlags**
(connected / fast / slow / incompatible / last-fail) between runs. Loaded at
start (before seeds), updated after IBD and on shutdown. Seeds are merged in
without clearing known flags. New writes are `rbitcoin-peers-v2` (IPv4, IPv6,
and Tor v3 `.onion:port` tokens). `rbitcoin-peers-v1` IPv4/IPv6 files still
load.

**Index modes:** Direct vs Tip: [`docs/concurrency.md`](../concurrency.md).
IBD finishes Class A + `tx.head` + spend annotations **before** tip; tip entry
does not backfill them. Scripthash: durable head stays Tip write-behind;
no head means Direct defers SH until a Class A collect + unsorted pack at
horizon. Confirm does **not** enqueue SH during Direct.

SIGINT keeps every sealed SH head; resume packs only unsealed shards (holes
stay; missing `DONE` restarts collect). `RBITCOIN_SH_FORCE_REBUILD=1` wipes the
head and does a full Class A collect + unsorted pack — unset after success
([`docs/env-knobs.md`](../env-knobs.md)). Missing `include_hwm` bootstraps
from SEAL (never clamp SEAL→0). Clearing residual run files **preserves
`SEAL`**. **SIGINT** mid cold keeps finished prefix shards
(`scripthash.cold_progress`). Materialize status logs ~**every 10s**.

On enter Direct, leftover `ibd_utxo.map` / `point.runs` / `tx.runs` from old
Catchup datadirs are removed — prefer a **fresh datadir**. Layout, shard
counts, ingest OA, and refuse lines: [`SCHEMA.md`](../../SCHEMA.md) and
[Schema upgrade](#schema-upgrade). Working-set sizes: SCHEMA census and
[`docs/ibd-memory.md`](../ibd-memory.md).

## Schema upgrade

Live bytes: [`SCHEMA.md`](../../SCHEMA.md) (`SCHEMA_VERSION = 26`). This section is
the operator copy-paste only — do not treat it as a second layout map.

Open **never silently wipes** a populated store (policy:
[`SCHEMA.md`](../../SCHEMA.md#changing-durable-bytes)). An older `store/meta` either
rewrites `meta` (payload-only) or **refuses** with a one-line message that
names the dirs. Corrupt files are **not** repaired in-process.

| Incoming `meta` | What this binary does |
|-----------------|------------------------|
| **26** | Open. |
| **25** | If `header.body` is still 96 B, rewrite each row to 88 B (`header.body.grow`, then rename), dropping trailing size and weight. An 88 B body is left alone. Then rewrite `meta` to 26. |
| **24** | Same header shrink as 25. Zero-extend `txstat.body` to the `create.loc` count (no `txout.body` rewrite). Unlink leftover `txfixed.body`. Rewrite `meta` to 26. |
| **23** | Headers stay 88 B. Rewrite `meta` to 26. `txstat.body` is created and aligned to the loc count when it is missing or short. |
| **22**, occupied Class A | Rewrite `create.loc.ovf` 12 B→16 B. Headers stay 88 B. Then the same `meta` rewrite and `txstat` align as 23. |
| **22**, empty Class A | Rewrite `meta` to 26, then open. |
| **Below 22**, empty or occupied | **Refuse.** One line: `schema before 22 refuses this datadir; wipe datadir and redo IBD`. Wipe the datadir and redo IBD. No per-version rewrite. |

On every open of meta 22–25 the node also renames leftover `inwit.*` to `seqsigwit.*` and `inputs.*` to `input.*`. A missing `input.loc` with seqsigwit prevouts backfills parent edges. A crash during the 96 B→88 B rewrite leaves the old `meta`; the next open retries the shrink. Size and weight after that come from `txstat`.

A `txstat.body` cell written as four ULEBs starting with `n_in` (an unreleased 25 experiment) is not detected and is not rewritten. Resync that datadir. A **25 binary** refuses 26 `meta`. A **24 binary** refuses 25 `meta` (do not downgrade in place). A **23 binary** refuses 24+ `meta`. A **22 binary** refuses 23+ `meta`. A **21 binary** refuses 22+ `meta`. A **19 binary** refuses 20+ `meta`.

When meta is below 22, the log line is:

```text
schema before 22 refuses this datadir; wipe datadir and redo IBD
```

A meta **22 or newer** datadir can still refuse leftover **index** layouts (fuse8 v1,
flat `*.idx.meta`, Shared file `scripthash.body`, pack8 Paged mode 10). The
line is one of:

```text
index refuses fuse8 v1; wipe store/tx.head and store/scripthash* then restart (Class A kept; tx.head rebuilds, SH rematerializes with --sh-index)
index refuses flat tx.head.meta; wipe store/tx.head then restart (Class A kept; tx.head rebuilds)
index refuses flat *.idx.meta; place files under store/{stem}.idx/ (meta + NNNNNN segments) then restart (Class A kept)
index refuses Shared (file) scripthash.body; wipe store/scripthash* then restart (Class A kept; SH rematerializes with --sh-index)
index refuses pack8 Paged (mode 10) scripthash heads; wipe store/scripthash* then restart (Class A kept; SH rematerializes with --sh-index)
```

Copy-paste (node stopped with SIGTERM):

```bash
DATADIR=/path/to/datadir
# fuse8 v1 / Shared SH body / Paged SH heads (same dirs as schema-20 index refuse):
rm -rf "$DATADIR/store/tx.head" "$DATADIR/store/scripthash"*
# leftover Class A `*.idx` dirs (schema 22 uses create.loc / seqsigwit.loc):
#   rm -rf "$DATADIR/store/txout.idx" "$DATADIR/store/spent.idx" "$DATADIR/store/seqsigwit.idx"
```

Keep Class A (`txout` / `seqsigwit` / `spent` + `create.loc` / `seqsigwit.loc`, `txid.body`, headers) and
Class C. Restart the same binary: `tx.head` rebuilds from Class A; with
`--sh-index`, SH rematerializes. Do **not** `rm -rf store/`.

**Kill-9 / crash is not a schema upgrade.** Open follows
[`docs/crash-recovery.md`](../crash-recovery.md) (tip-as-commit, Class C
repair above tip). Prefer SIGTERM ([Resume / clean stop](#resume--clean-stop)).
A corrupt file still means wipe/reindex — not an in-process repair.

## Scripthash index (`--sh-index`)

Class B **scripthash** reverse index is **optional** (default **off**), analogous
in *operator spirit* to Core’s heavy reverse indexes — **not** the same as
Core `-txindex` (we always keep Class A + `tx.head` for by-txid lookup).

| Mode | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| **off (default)** | No SH run enqueue during IBD; no tip bulk materialize. Tip follow + mempool relay + JSON-RPC work without SH. |
| **on** (`--sh-index` / `sh_index=1`) | Direct IBD defers SH. Tip entry runs two Class A scans, then pack and seal; write-behind follows. Address/scripthash Electrum/Esplora methods work after that seal. |

Electrum/Esplora **start without** `--sh-index`. Address/scripthash methods then fail closed (`scripthash index disabled`). Txid/outpoint/block/fees still work. Matrix: [`docs/lightning.md`](../../docs/lightning.md).

`--esplora-block-template` (conf `esplora_block_template=1`) enables
`GET /block-template` on the Esplora listen (same JSON as RPC
`getblocktemplate` template mode). Default **off** (404).

`--max-sh-creates N` (conf `max_sh_creates=`) defaults to **10000**. An unpaged
Electrum history or full stats join with more than N creates is refused
before Class A expand: Esplora **503** / Electrum JSON-RPC error
`scripthash join exceeds --max-sh-creates (default 10000)`. **0** is unlimited.
A history request that names a page (Esplora's 25, or any caller that sets a
limit) is still served: the join stops once that page is full.

Order-of-magnitude costs (mainnet-class SSD; not a warranty):

- **During IBD with sh_index=1:** modest extra work (run stream); after IBD, bulk materialize is typically **tens of minutes to a few hours**.
- **Enable after tip already synced:** full recollect/materialize from Class A — **often multi-hour**; tip follow continues; Electrum waits until SH ready.
- **Disable later:** tables are **left on disk** (no automatic purge). Re-enable may rematerialize.

Tip-follow readiness is **independent** of SH materialize (`tip_follow_ready` ≠ `sh_tip_ready`).

### Abort / resume (tip materialize)

Keep **`store/scripthash.unsorted/`** until every shard has
`scripthash.head/NN.packed`. That mark is the pack commit. Pass-1
`.mphf`+`.val` without it is not sealed. Resume rules:
[`docs/crash-recovery.md`](../crash-recovery.md) (scripthash cold resume).
Extra disk during build is **`SHKSP01` spills** plus **`SHPST01` post spills**.
Restart with the same `--datadir --sh-index`. Do not delete unsorted files
to start over unless you intend a full Class A collect
(`RBITCOIN_SH_FORCE_REBUILD`). A spill whose magic is not `SHKSP01` or
`SHPST01` is Corrupt — wipe `store/scripthash.unsorted` and rematerialize.

| Stop | What restart does |
|------|-------------------|
| No valid `DONE.keys` | Delete unsorted and restart pass 1. Seal rewrites the MPHF. |
| `DONE.keys`, no `DONE.post` | Keep pass-1 MPHF; discard partial `post/` spills; pass 2 from fk 1; pack. Electrum stays down. |
| `DONE.post`, some `.packed` | Pack only the unmarked shards. |
| All `.packed` | Tip write-behind. A second start does not collect. Electrum stays down until `include_hwm` covers the tip, then this process binds it. |
| Complete head, no marks, no extract | Soft-migrate: write `.packed`. Missing `include_hwm` is set from the create count. |
| Kill-9 mid pack | Unfinished shard is redone. Open follows [`docs/crash-recovery.md`](../crash-recovery.md). |
| Corrupt SH (leftover live OA, mixed body, refuse line) | Wipe `store/scripthash*` only, keep Class A, rematerialize with `--sh-index`. |

Electrum waits until SH is tip-ready. Do **not** `rm -rf store/` for an SH
abort. Force-rebuild sticky env (`RBITCOIN_SH_FORCE_REBUILD`) must never redo
multi-hour Class A work casually — [`docs/env-knobs.md`](../env-knobs.md).

## Silent payment tweaks (`--sp-tweaks`)

Optional **thin** BIP-352 index for Electrum `blockchain.tweaks.subscribe`
(Cake Wallet, [kiss-bdk](https://github.com/kkdao/kiss-bdk); client-side
scan). Default **off**. The method still exists when off (naive per-height
walk). Flag on = persist + serve-from-index. Stream shape and Sparrow/Frigate:
[`COMPAT.md`](../../COMPAT.md) (Electrum surface).

**Not built during Direct IBD** (the write thread stays Class A + annotate).
After catch-up, **SH materialize first** (if `--sh-index`), then a background
walker fills `origin..=live tip` from Class A. Tip write-through only when
`height == next_height`; if confirm is ahead, backfill owns the hole. Kill
is safe: `next_height` is the last complete put; restart in Tip (or after
the next Direct catch-up reaches tip) resumes the walker. Electrum during
the hole uses the naive path.

On disk (schema 17 dirs; leftover single files are unlinked on startup):

| File | Contents |
|------|----------|
| `store/sp_tweaks.idx/` | `meta` (`origin` + fmt 3) + `NNNNNN` tip-only `u32` start offs (no `header_fk`) |
| `store/sp_tweaks.body/` | Matching `NNNNNN` files: per tx `len=0` or `len=33` + compressed `A_tweak`. New pair when the next start would exceed 4 GiB. |

**Not stored:** txids, Taproot outs, values, parent scripts. Notify
`output_pubkeys` are joined from this block’s **`txout`** body (~12 ms
sequential on a 4k-tx 9p block; witness stays in `seqsigwit`). Indexed serve does
**not** parent-peek (~40–80 blk/s vs ~1.5–3 naive on that VM).

Serve-time **`--sp-tweaks-dust SATS`** (conf `sp_tweaks_dust=`) omits P2TR outs
with `value <= SATS` and drops txs that then have none. Default **1000**.
`0` serves every value. **`546` matches Cake electrs** `sp_min_dust`. This is
not Core dust: P2TR at 1 sat/vB is about **330** sats; 546 is the P2PKH
figure Cake’s server used. The index is unchanged — only the Electrum JSON.

IBD seals the index from the taproot origin (709632 on mainnet) when
`--sp-tweaks` is on from the start, on the confirm write thread, shared with
`--block-filter-index`. A restart gap of at most one write drain is sealed
at startup; a later enable still materializes after catch-up
(`rbtc-idx-wb`). Once the watermark covers the tip, new blocks are sealed on
the confirm write thread. That materialize is one IO thread reading windows of heights on one completion session
(`seqsigwit` and parent txids only for P2TR-output txs); one CPU thread
(`rbtc-idx-cpu`) publishes one job per height to `rbtc-scripts-*` (tweak EC,
and filter GCS when that index is on) and commits one batched height-blob +
idx write per window. A catch-up wave shares that pool with block scripts for
at most one window. Reorg truncates with tip. Kill-safe: `next_height` is the
last complete put. INFO every 10 s: `index: build next=… tip=… rate=…/s
remain=… read=…ms build=…ms commit=…ms`.

Cake Wallet’s scan isolate may still hardcode `electrs.cakewallet.com` even
after a successful probe — see `COMPAT.md`.
