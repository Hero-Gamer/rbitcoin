# Mempool fee estimation (rbitcoin)

## Product opinion: 10-minute inclusion is the standard API

The **default** fee estimate this node advertises answers:

> If current mempool pressure and admit/evict/relay flows continue, what feerate
> still gets a package into the next few blocks **after about 10 minutes**?

| Surface | Role |
|---------|------|
| Electrum `blockchain.estimatefee` (default / primary) | **10-minute inclusion** |
| Esplora fee endpoints (primary) | Same |
| Optional target-depth knobs | **Near:** flow invert. **Far:** block history. Blended. |

Once flow is warm, the 1-block target is live stock and capped admit-EMA at
99.9% confidence, conditional on the next block arriving within 10 minutes;
history answers only when flow has nothing to say. Targets from 2 blocks blend
the flow rate with the 99% historical rate as `w·R_flow + (1-w)·R_hist`,
`w(N)=exp(-(N-1)/6)`, so neither is a floor for the other (`w(2)≈0.85`). While
flow is cold, history answers alone and the live pool may only raise it.

## Non-blocking vs accept (published snapshot)

Fee APIs **do not** walk the live mempool graph on every Electrum/Esplora request.

| Path | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| Accept / remove | Marks fee cache **dirty** only (no recompute on the admit critical path). |
| Refresh | Singleflight: at most one recompute; **one** `mining_chunks_best_first` under a short hub read lock, then pure math off-lock for all depths. |
| Request | Loads a published `Arc` snapshot (≤ **~1 s** stale when dirty/max-age). Histogram and frontier use the **same** published chunk list. |

This avoids fee-estimates holding the hub lock for multi-second full-pool linearizes (which previously blocked accepts and vice versa). Estimates may lag a short bound after fee spikes. Min-relay is a policy floor only. Confirm-memory clips **N=1** only.

## Engine v2 (shipped)

**Temporal flow projection** under the same APIs as v1:

1. **Clock is mempool flow, not last-block age.** Always plan block *k* at
   **T + 10 k minutes** (`capacity_wu = N × 4_000_000`). Never stretch by wall
   time since the last tip.
2. **Live stock:** mining-chunk weight strictly above candidate rate R
   (`weight_above_feerate` / frontier).
3. **Inflow EMA:** per feerate bucket, exponential moving average of admitted
   package/chunk weight per second (`FeeFlowMeter` on successful accept).
4. **Include at R** when
   `stock_above(R) + λ(c)·projected_inflow(R, min(N×600s, 600s)) ≤ fill(c) × N × 4e6`.
   `c(N)` is 0.999 at N=1 and 0.99 for N≥2. `fill(0.999)=0.80`,
   `fill(0.99)=0.95`; `λ(0.999)=2`, `λ(0.99)=1`. Inflow horizon is capped at
   ~4 admit half-lives so a 150 s EMA is not stretched to a week.
5. **Frontier** is the marginal chunk at `N×4e6` WU. If the pool is thinner
   than N blocks, stock does **not** set a far rate (no last-chunk-as-far).
   With warm flow, near depths (`w≥0.5`, N=1–5) with any live stock still
   answer min-relay (the next few blocks have room).
6. **Blend (warm flow):** N=1 is `R_flow`, or `R_hist` when flow is undefined.
   N≥2 is `w·R_flow + (1-w)·R_hist` with `w=exp(-(N-1)/6)`; a missing side
   drops out. Then enforce `R(1)≥R(2)≥…`.
7. **N=1** with warm flow may additionally clip to the confirm-memory **p90**
   (64-sample ring; not max-of-64), and falls back to it when neither flow nor
   history has a rate. Long N does not.

**Cold start:** until the flow meter is warm (≥60 s wall and ≥32 admits), a
restarted pool can be thin or missing what peers relayed while the node was
down, so each target is `R_hist`, raised to the frontier when the pool reaches
that deep, and never lowered by the pool. A target whose history is not ready
has no rate. The refresh evaluates eleven depths (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 20,
144, 504, 1008) and no others. If **no** depth has a rate, APIs return
insufficient (RPC / Electrum `-1`; Esplora leaves the target out and answers
**503** when no target has a rate). If a nearer depth is defined and a later
one is not, **hold the last defined rate** through the later computed depths
so those depths do not drop out. A confirm target between two computed depths
that both have rates is the straight line between those rates in block count,
in whole sat/kvB (nearest, halves away from zero, kept between the two rates).
A target past the last defined depth holds that rate. A target before every
defined depth stays insufficient. Esplora `/fee-estimates` answers each integer
from 1 through 25, plus 144, 504, and 1008, when that target has a rate. The
node logs when flow warms and how many targets' history is ready.

### Confirm-memory / block history

Confirmed mempool entries' feerates on `remove_for_block` fill a 64-sample
ring (**N=1 p90 clip**). Process-local.

`R_hist` reads the **chain**, not this pool. Each block's hurdle is the
vsize-weighted p10 of individual confirmed transaction feerates, from its
stored `txstat` rows alone; rates below min relay (out-of-band or zero-fee
inclusions) are dropped first. A block with no hurdle left (coinbase-only, or
every tx below min relay) is not an observation: windows count only blocks
that carried transactions, so an N-block confidence is conditional on those
blocks carrying transactions. On mainnet such blocks are ~0.1% and almost
always isolated; counting them as misses made the 99.9% 1-block target
unanswerable about half the time.

**Analog windows.** For target N, each window of N hurdle blocks pairs the
median hurdle of the `L = clamp(N/4, 3, 144)` blocks before it with the lowest
hurdle inside it (a tx at that rate would have beaten some block's p10). An
estimate keeps the windows whose lookback median is within ×1.25 of the
current lookback median (at least the 200 nearest) and takes the 99% quantile
of their lowest hurdles (99.9% at N=1). Windows that started inside a spike
stop steering a calm market, and a spike in progress finds the windows that
started inside past spikes. A target answers once it holds 2000 windows: at
least 2000 + L + N − 1 hurdle blocks.

On a mainnet backtest over ~2.9 years of `txstat` (every 36 blocks, each
estimate from the 1 GiB before it, scored against the next N hurdle blocks),
analog windows covered 99.1–99.5% at 2–144 blocks and 99.91% at 1 block
(99.9% target), at a median 2.0–3.3× the realized hurdle (7.1× at 1 block).
Flat quantiles over the same history covered 98.5–99.8% at 9–20× (46× at 1
block), because a spike kept steering estimates for months. Long targets
(504/1008) cover ~97.7%; their windows overlap so heavily that about a
hundred are independent. These are empirical predictions from overlapping
windows, not formal statistical guarantees.

**Budget and preload.** History is keyed by height and bounded by 1 GiB of
`txstat.body` cells (8 B per tx, coinbase included): ~31k mainnet blocks at a
2026 tip. When relay turns on, the node restores the history file, then scans
backward from the tip until the budget is met, reading no `spent.body` data or
transaction bodies and no height it already holds (~12 s per GiB cold on the
agent VM). A connect at `h` replaces any branch above it. Analog windows are
kept in step as blocks are added or dropped at either end; an insert between
held heights rebuilds them once before the next estimate, and estimates are
recomputed only after the history changes. RAM: ~5.5 MiB of windows at 11
targets; CPU: ~2 ms per new block for all targets.

**History file.** `mempool/fee_history` is a snapshot (height, hurdle, cells
per height, plus the newest 144 block hashes), rewritten after each preload
and every 144 connects (~500 KiB, one fsync). `mempool/fee_history.log` is a
journal of 52-byte records (height, cells, hurdle, block hash, check) appended
per connect without fsync. On load the journal replays onto the snapshot only
if it extends that snapshot, stops at a torn record, and everything above the
newest stored hash still on the best chain is dropped (a reorg while down).
The file is a cache of `txstat`: a damaged, foreign, or other-version file is
dropped with a log line and those heights are read from the chain again. The
preload log line reports heights from the file, heights read, skips,
failures, ready targets, and elapsed time.

### Histogram / relayfee

Live chunk histogram remains a **stock** snapshot (transparency). Libre min
relay (0.1 sat/vB) floors any defined number.

## Template readiness (non-goal: full mining)

Frontier/chunk snapshots are shaped so a later block-template consumer can reuse
mining order. This document does **not** specify `getblocktemplate`, coinbase
construction, or witness nonces.

## Non-goals

- Full Core `estimatesmartfee` Bayesian wait-time tracker (we use per-block
  included p10s, not first-seen delay buckets)
- Full multi-node flow aggregation / peer bandwidth models
- Changing Libre min relay, dust, or full-RBF defaults
- Persisting flow meters across process restart (process-local; fee
  history is persisted, flow is not)
