# 036 — Public Electrum surface

**Severity:** critical
**Status:** fixed
**Found by:** coordinated review, 2026-09-21 and 2026-09-22 (C07, C08, C09, C10)

An unpaged scripthash join above `--max-sh-creates` is refused. The
default is 10000. **0** is unlimited. A history request that names a page
is served even above the cap, and Class A expand stops once that page is
full.

Silent-payment subscribe does not write the scan secret to the API log.
The log file is owner-only. A start of 0 is the last 256 blocks. The
historical scan runs on the blocking pool, 256 heights per hold of a
3-permit process semaphore, one scan per connection. It uses the tweak
index (`tweaks_for_height`), not the scripthash index.

Outpoint subscriptions stop at the same per-connection cap as scripthash
subscriptions. Tip restatus looks up those outpoints off the connection task.
